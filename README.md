Problem statement

In 2011, India defeated Pakistan in the ICC World Cup semis and is now geared up to take on Sri Lanka in the finals. Meanwhile, the Indian Ministry of Tourism is slapping a 30% service charge on hotel profits during April 1 and 2 to foot the event's bill.

Hotels are cashing in by tripling their usual room rates. The manager at Holiday Inn Hotels is sweating over pricing tactics â€“ worried that if he increases the price to such high rates, the room occupancy won't be full, and he won't be able to sustain the profits.

Guess who's riding in to save the day? You, the freelance whiz! Help the manager strategize the pricing by developing a spreadsheet model to calculate occupancy and profits at various room rates.
